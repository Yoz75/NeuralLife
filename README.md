## Types:
Red static cells are food, that bugs eat.<br>
Gray static cells are spikes, bugs die when stands on them.<br>
Moving green (or not green) cells are bugs, every division their color some changes (the more bug's neural network mutates, the more color changes).<br>

## How does it works:
Neural network sees 24 near cells (neighbors and their neighbors), knows self health and energy, then some magic and boom - it returns direction, where bug will move!

## Controls:
R - restart simulation (other properties will save)<br>
Q - spawn spikes<br>
T - increase food life time<br>
Y - decrease food life time<br>
Plus - increase food spawn count<br>
Minus - decrease food spawn count<br>
